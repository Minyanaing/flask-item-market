# Flask Tutorial
This repository contains the test code that are developed during the `flask` web application tutorial. This tutorial was developed by **Jim** from [JimShapedCoding](http://www.jimshapedcoding.com/courses/Flask%20Full%20Series) and can easily learn on YouTube.

The required libraries can be installed as:
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-wtf
pip install wtforms
pip install flask_bcrypt
pip install flask_login
```
We can the python as `python3 run.py` and I was using `python 3.8` in this tutorial.
